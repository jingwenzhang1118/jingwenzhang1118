Motivated by practical issues, my research focus broadly on managerial accounting, corporate governance, and ESG topics. In particular, my papers examine how to design control and incentive systems to motivate and support employees and managers, to balnace strategic behaviors and long-term goals of organizations.

 rely on empirical evidence to examine my research questions. I collect, organize and analyze both field data that are gathered from invididual companies and public data collected through public databases and web-scraping.

## Charitable CEOs
<div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify">  <b>Do charitable CEOs, those take positions in charities, make corporate decisions differently? Do they care more about their employees and deliver better ESG performance? The answer is YES. </b> 
</div>

Recently, firms and individuals face high expectations that they behave responsibly. Not only increasing individuals volunteer for chritable organizations, CEOs have been observed to take positions, such as trustees, members or directors at chariatlable organizations as well. Although there are concerns that CEOs may involve in charities for social image, our paper finds that charitable CEOs are more likely prosocial in nature and they invest more in ESG activities. Consequently, their behaviors are appreciated by the employees. Meanwhile, charitable CEOs behave responsibly in other corporate decisions as well, such as issuing financial reports of greater qualtiy and providing more accurate management forecasts to stakeholders.

## Human capital investment and Supporting underperforming Employees
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> <b> Should firms give up on their underperforming employees? Actually NO, and a better strategy is to provide human capital investment to underperforming employees that still have the potential to improve. </b>
 </div>

Undoubtedly employees are the most valuable assets of an organization. Motivated employees reach new targets, develop new and innovative products, meet the market's demands, and perform great efforts to acheive the company's objectives. However, some employees miss the target because they may lack the necessary management knowledge and skills but have a great potential to improve. Our paper shows that when employees underperform the targets but outperform their peers, it is beneficial for firms to provide training and mentoring opportunities to these employees, rather than dismiss them. With such human capital investment, underperforming employees can enhance their performance and thus firms have greater chances to maintain good performance.

## Target ratcheting and effort withholding
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> <b> Most firms consider the positive impacts of target setting on employees' efforts. Although it is tempting to ratchet targets to make the targets more challenging, firms should be cautious with such a plan and in some cases firms gain more from not making the targets too difficult. </b>
 </div>

Setting targets for employees serves multiple purposes, among which include encouraging high efforts, directing employees' behaviors, providing monetary rewards and evaluating employees' performance. However, firms may neglect the fact that when firms keep ratcheting targets employees will withhold their efforts. Such strategic behaviors occur because employees know that good perfomrance leads to more difficult targets in the future, and they decide to withhold efforts now to avoid significant target rathceting of the next period, so that they can increase the chance of meeting the future targets. Our study shows that firms do not need to worry that less target ratcheting may result in lower efforts, especially for employees who are always committed to their work and have continuously performed better than the peers. These well-performing employees have shown their intension to work hard and hence developed trust and a good relation with the organization. Therefore less target ratcheting leads to a win-win situation for the firm and these committed employees because the pay of these employees is better insured and the firm benefits from high efforts of these employees.

## Knowledge Exchange and spillover effects through headquarter site visits
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> <b> headquarter visits directly facilitate knowledge exchange between headquarter managers and unit managers being visited. But what is often overlooked is that unit managers that are not visited by headquarter managers also beneift from the visits through knowledge spillovers among peers.</b>

    <p>Headquarters' visits at local units are common practices implemented by organizations to facilitate knowledge transfer. Headquarter managers can share their knowldge and help local managers via face-to-face communications and on-site training. This paper finds that, With improved management practices, local managers who are visited by headquarter managers indeed enhance performance after the site visits. Another interesting finding of the paper is that local managers that are not visited by headquarter managers but are located close to those who are visited by headquarter managers can also improve performance after the visits. These managers are able to achieve better performance even without site visits is because they can learn from their peers' improved practices. Overall, site visits do not only benefit local managers via direct knowledge exchange between headquarter managers and unit managers, they also indirectly help local managers who are not visited via knowledge spillover among local managers.

## Superios' control and characteristics of middle-level managers
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> <b> Middle-level managers are the engine of the business. As managers prefer different working styles, controlling them in the same way does not achieve the best performnace. Superiors should know their subordinates well and adjust their controls to enable managers of different characteristics to work in their preferable ways.
 </b>
 </div>

As the connection between upper management and front-line employees, middle-level managers are of great importance to firms. This project considers two characteristics of middle-level managers: conformity and originality. Both types of managers are valuable to firms. Conformative managers are willing to comply with rules, which reduces the conflicts in the workforce and smoothes the cooperation among employees. On the other hand, original managers prefer exploring new ideas, which is helpful when the tasks are chanllenging and cannot be solved by existing methods. We find that superiors indeed know their subordiantes sufficiently and adapt their controls. Superiors talk more with conformative managers but these talks are mostly initiated by the managers. These talks assure the comformative managers that their decisions are aligned with the firms' objectives. On the contrary, supeirios allocate more complicated tasks to original managers but the discussions between original managers and supeiors are often requested by superiors. Such controls limit the chances that original managers take too risky steps and allow supeiors to closely follow the progress of the projects. The findings suggest that controls become more effective by consiering middle-level managers' preferences.
