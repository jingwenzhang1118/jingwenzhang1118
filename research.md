Motivated by practical issues, my research focus broadly on managerial accounting, corporate governance, and ESG topics. In particular, my papers examine how to design control and incentive systems to motivate and support employees and managers, to balnace strategic behaviors and long-term goals of organizations.

To examine my research questions, I rely on empirical evidence. I collect, organize and analyze both field data that are gathered from invididual companies and public data collected through public databases and web-scraping.

## Charitable CEOs
<div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify">  <b>Do charitable CEOs, those take positions in charities, make corporate decisions differently? Do they care more about their employees and deliver better ESG performance? The answer is YES. </b> 
</div>

Recently, firms and individuals face high expectations that they behave responsibly. Not only increasing individuals volunteer for chritable organizations, CEOs have been observed to take positions, such as trustees, members or directors at chariatlable organizations as well. Although there are concerns that CEOs may involve in charities for social image, our paper finds that charitable CEOs are more likely prosocial in nature and they invest more in ESG activities. Consequently, their behaviors are appreciated by the employees. Meanwhile, charitable CEOs behave responsibly in other corporate decisions, such as issuing financial reports of greater qualtiy and providing more accurate management forecasts to stakeholders.

## Human capital investment and Supporting underperforming Employees
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> <b> Should firms give up on their underperforming employees? Actually NO, and a better strategy is to provide human capital investment to underperforming employees that still have the potential to improve. </b>
 </div>

Undoubtedly employees are the most valuable assets of an organization. Motivated employees reach new targets, develop new and innovative products, meet the market's demands, and perform great efforts to acheive the company's objectives. However, some employees may lack of the necessary management knowledge and skills but have a great potential to improve. Our paper shows that when employees miss the targets but perform better relative to the peers, it is beneficial for firms to provide training and mentoring opportunities to these employees. With such human capital investment, underperforming employees can enhance their performance and thus firms have greater chances to maintain good performance.

## Target ratcheting and effort withholding
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> <b> Most firms consider the positive impacts of targets on employees' efforts. Although it is tempting to ratchet targets to make the targets more challenging, firms should be cautious with such a plan and in some cases firms gain more from not making the targets too difficult. </b>
 </div>

Setting targets for employees serves multiple purposes, among which include encouraging high efforts, directing employees' behaviors, providing monetary rewards and evaluating employees' performance. However, firms may neglect the fact that when firms keep ratcheting targets employees will withhold efforts. Such strategic behaviors occur because employees know that good perfomrance leads to more difficult targets in the future, and they can withhold efforts now to avoid significant target rathceting of the next period, to increase the chance of meeting the targets again. Our study shows that firms do not need to worry that less target ratcheting results in lower efforts, especially for employees who are always committed to their work and have continuously performed better than the peers. These well-performing employees have shown their intension to work hard and hence developed trust and a good relation with the organization. Therefore less target ratcheting leads to a win-win situation that employees are better insured about their pay and the firm benefits from high efforts of these employees.
