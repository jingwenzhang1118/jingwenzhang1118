Motivated by real-life issues, my research focus broadly on managerial accounting, corporate governance, and ESG topics. In particular, my papers examine how to design control and incentive systems to motivate and support employees and managers, to balnace strategic behaviors and long-term goals of organizations.

## Charitable CEOs

<div style="background-color: platinum; color: black">  <i>Are charitable CEOs --- those take positions in charities --- make corporate decisions differently? Do they care more about their employees and deliver better ESG performance? The answer is <b>YES</b>.</i> 
</div>

Recently, firms and individuals face high expectations that they behave responsibly. Not only increasing individuals volunteer for chritable organizations, CEOs have been observed to take positions, such as trustees, members or directors at chariatlable organizations as well. Although there are concerns that CEOs may involve in charities for social image, we find that charitable CEOs are more likely prosocial in nature and they invest more in ESG activities. Consequently, their behaviors are appreciated by the employees. Meanwhile, charitable CEOs behave responsibly in other corporate decisions, such as issuing financial reports of greater qualtiy and providing more accurate management forecasts to stakeholders.

<h2> Human capital investment and Supporting underperforming Employees >/h2

Should firms give up on underperforming employees? A better solution is to provide human capital investment to underperforming employees that still have potential to improve. 
</div>

Undoubtedly employees are the most valuable assets of an organization. Motivated employees reach new targets, develop new and innovative products, meet the market's demands, and perform great efforts to acheive the company's objectives. However, some employees may lack of the necessary management knowledge and skills but have a great potential to improve. Our paper shows that when employees miss the targets but perform better relative to the peers, it is beneficial for firms to provide training and mentoring opportunities to these employees. With such human capital investment, underperforming employees can enhance their performance and thus firms have greater chances to maintain good performance.
