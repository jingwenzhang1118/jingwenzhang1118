Motivated by practical issues, my research focuses broadly on managerial accounting, corporate governance and ESG topics. In particular, my papers examine how to design control and incentive systems to motivate and support employees and managers. The goal is to balance short-term strategic behaviors and long-term goals of organizations.

I leverage empirical evidence to investigate my research questions. I collect, organize and analyze field data gathered from invididual companies, as well as public data collected through public databases and web scraping.

## Charitable CEOs
<div class="desc">  Do charitable CEOs taking positions in charities make corporate decisions differently? Do they care more about their employees and deliver better ESG performance? The answer is YES.

    <p>Recently, both firms and individuals face high expectations that they behave responsibly. Not only individuals volunteer for chritable organizations, CEOs have been observed taking up roles as trustees, members or directors at chariatlable organizations as well. Although concerns persist that CEOs engage with charities for enhancing social image, our paper uncovers that charitable CEOs are likely prosocial in nature. They invest more in ESG activities and consequently garner appreciation from the employees. Furthermore, charitable CEOs behave responsibly in other corporate decisions, such as issuing higher quality financial reports and offering more precise management forecasts to stakeholders.

## Human capital investment and supporting underperforming employees
<div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify">Should firms give up on their underperforming employees? The answer is a resounding NO. A better strategy is to provide human capital investment to those underperforming employees who still have the potential for improvement.

    <p>Undoubtedly employees are the most valuable assets of an organization. Motivated employees reach new targets, develop innovative products, meet market demands, and dedicate great efforts to realizing company objectives. However, certain employees miss the target due to a deficiency in requisite management knowledge and skills despite having the potential for improvement. Our research shows that when employees underperform the targets but outperform their peers, it is beneficial for firms to provide training and mentoring opportunities to these employees, rather than dismiss them. Through such investment in human capital, underperforming employees can elevate their performance, consequently enhancing a firm's probability of sustaining good performance.

## Target ratcheting and effort withholding
<div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> Most firms recognize the beneficial effects of setting targets on motivating employees' efforts. Although it is tempting to increase the challenge by ratcheting targets, firms should be cautious with such an approach and in some cases firms gain more by refraining from making the targets too difficult.

    <p>Setting targets for employees serves multiple purposes, including encouraging high levels of effort, directing employees' behaviors, providing monetary rewards and evaluating performance. However, firms may neglect the fact that continuous target ratcheting result in reduced employee efforts. This strategic behaviors occur because employees recognize that strong perfomrance leads to even more difficult targets in the future. As a preemptive measure, employees choose to to withhold efforts now to avoid significant target rathceting in the following period, so that they increase their chances of meeting future targets. Our study reveals that firms need not to worry that less target ratcheting leads to reduced efforts, especially among employees consistently committed to their work and outperforming their peers. These high-performing employees have demonstrated their commitment to hard work, and hence developed trust and a good relation with the organization. Therefore limited target ratcheting yields a win-win situation for the firm and these committed employees. The pay of these employees is insured and the firm benefits from high efforts of these employees.

## Knowledge exchange and spillover effects through headquarter site visits
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> Headquarter visits directly facilitate knowledge exchange between headquarter managers and unit managers they visited. But what is often overlooked is that unit managers who do not receive visits from headquarter managers also beneift from these site visits through knowledge spillovers among peers.

    <p>The practice of headquarters' visits to local units is a common strategy implemented by organizations to facilitate knowledge transfer. During these visits, headquarter managers can share their knowldge and assist local managers via face-to-face communications and on-site training. This study shows two noteworthy results. First, local managers who receive visits indeed enhance performance through improved management practices. Second, an interesting discovery is that local managers that are directly visited by headquarter managers but are located close to those who are visited experience performance improvements following these visits. This is attributed to the fact that these managers can learn from their peers' improved practices. Overall, site visits do not only benefit local managers via direct knowledge exchange between headquarter managers and unit managers, but also indirectly help local managers who do not receive visits through knowledge spillover among peers.

## Superios' control and characteristics of middle-level managers
 <div style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify"> Middle-level managers serve as the engine of the business. Given that managers prefer distinct working styles, applying the same control approach cannot achieve the best performnace. Superiors should know their subordinates well and adjust their controls accordingly to enable managers with varying characteristics to work in their preferable ways.

    <p>Being the connection between upper management and front-line employees, middle-level managers hold significant importance for firms. This project considers two distinct characteristics of middle-level managers: conformity and originality, both of which are valuable to firms. Conformative managers are willing to comply with established rules, reducing the conflicts in the workforce and smoothing the cooperation among employees. On the other hand, original managers are inclined to explore new ideas, proving benefits for tackling challenging tasks that cannot be solved using existing methods. We find that superiors know their subordiantes sufficiently and adapt their controls accordingly. Conformative managers discuss more frequently with superiors and these talks are mostly initiated by the managers themselves. These discussions assure comformative managers that their decisions align with the firm's objectives. In contrast, original managers are assigned more complicated tasks and also have more discussions with superiors but the discussions are often requested by superiors. These controls mitigate the chances that original managers take risky steps and allow supeiors to closely follow the project progress. The findings suggest that controls can be more effective by consiering the characteristics of middle-level managers.
