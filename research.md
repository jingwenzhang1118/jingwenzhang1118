## Charitable CEOs

<mark bacground-color: grey> <i>Are charitable CEOs --- those take positions in charities --- make corporate decisions differently? Do they care more about their employees and deliver better ESG performance? The answer is <b>YES</b>.</i> </mark>

Not only increasing individuals volunteer for chritable organizations, CEOs have been observed to take positions, such as trustees, members or directors at chariatlable organizations as well. Although there are concerns that CEOs may involve in charities for social image, we find that charitable CEOs are more likely prosocial in nature and they invest more in ESG activities. Consequently, their behaviors are appreciated by the employees. Meanwhile, charitable CEOs behave responsibly in other corporate decisions, such as issuing financial reports of greater qualtiy and providing more accurate management forecasts to stakeholders.

Our paper shows that rather than dismissing all the underperforming employees, it is beneficial for firms to improve
