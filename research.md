Motivated by real-life issues, my research focus broadly on managerial accounting, corporate governance, and ESG topics. In particular, my papers examine how to design control and incentive systems to motivate and support employees and managers, to balnace strategic behaviors and long-term goals of organizations.

### Charitable CEOs

<p background-color=grey> *Are charitable CEOs --- those take positions in charities --- make corporate decisions differently? Do they care more about their employees and develier better ESG performance?* The simple answer is **YES**. </p>


Recently, firms and individuals face high expectations that they behave responsibly. Not only increasing individuals volunteer for chritable organizations, CEOs have been observed to take positions, such as trustees, members or directors at chariatlable organizations as well. Although there are concerns that CEOs may involve in charities for social image, we find that charitable CEOs invest more in ESG activities, and their behaviors are more appreciated by the employees. Meanwhile, charitable CEOs behave responsibly in other corporate decisions, such as issuing financial reports of greater qualtiy and providing more accurate management forecasts to stakeholders.
