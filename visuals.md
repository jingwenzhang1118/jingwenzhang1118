Drawing graphs is of great importnat for exploring data structure, identifying trends and clusters, detecting unusual data points and presenting results. Figures can quickly communicate a significant amount of information. It is without a doubt that *a good graph is worth a thousand words*. 

Here I display some figures I draw using Python. In particular, I will use these figures to explore the trend of CSR performance, and its association with some firm characteristics. The CSR rating is collected from KLD database for the period from 2004 to 2018.
