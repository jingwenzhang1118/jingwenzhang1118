CS50 is a highly evaluated computer science course that teaches languates C, python and SQL and focuses on topics like computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. 

Here I include the codes I use to solve the *Problem sets* of each topic. The original questions of each topic (week) can be found on [CS50's website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). 

My codes for addressing the *Practical problems* and *Labs* of each topic can be found [here](https://github.com/jingwenzhang1118/CS50_complete/tree/main).
