CS50 is a highly evaluated computer science course that teaches how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security and software engineering. Languages include C, Python and SQL, etc. 

Here I include the codes I used to solve the questions of the *Practice problems*,  *labs*, and *Problem sets*. The original questions of each topic/week can be found on [CS50's website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/).
