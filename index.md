Welcome to my homepage!

I am an assistant professor in Accounting at Erasmus School of Economics (ESE), Erasmum University Rotterdam (EUR). 

I have conducted quantitative research on topics including incentive contracts, performance measurements, target setting, management controls, human capital, and ESG issues. I am excited to identify people's performance pattern from the data, in order to design effective incentive plans and control strategies. The findings rely on varying types of firms, such as retail chains, franchise, manufacturing firms and large public firms.

I use different programming languages (e.g., Stata/Python/SQL) for data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. I applied different empirical models and machine learning algorithms to exploit variouds kinds of data, including big data, field data and survey data. 

I have good communication, presentation and teaching skills developed through team-working with co-authors and other faculties, presentations at top accounting conferences and teaching various courses.
